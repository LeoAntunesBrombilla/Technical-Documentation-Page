            Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming
            language.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
            notable use of significant whitespace
          </li>
          <li>
            Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help
            programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>Python is dynamically typed</li>
          <li>Python is garbage-collected</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
          (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional
          programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
          language due to its comprehensive standard library.

        <p>
          In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
          presence or absence of prompts and to repeat the example, you must
          type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that
          do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that
          a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must
          type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command. Many of
          the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive
          prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash
          character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment
          may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but
          not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal
          is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are
          not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in
          examples.
        </p>

        Some examples:
        <div>
          <pre>
            <code>
                    # this is the first comment 
                    spam = 1 # and this is the second comment
                             # ... and now a third! 
                    text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
            </code>
         </pre>

        <header><h2>Using Python as a Calculator</h2></header>
        <h3>Numbers</h3>
        <p>
          The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
          expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is
          straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most
          other languages; parentheses can be used for grouping. For example:
        </p>
        <div>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> 2 + 2
                    4
                    >>> 50 - 5*6
                    20
                    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
                    5.0
                    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
                    1.6
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          The integer numbers have type int, the ones with a fractional part
          have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the
          tutorial. Division / always returns a float. To do floor division and
          get an integer result discarding any fractional result you can use the
          // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
        <header><h2>Strings</h2></header>
        <p>
          Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be
          expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes
          ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used
          to escape quotes:
        </p>
        <div>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
                    'spam eggs'
                    >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
                    "doesn't"
                    >>> '"Yes," they said.'
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
                    '"Yes," they said.'
                    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                    '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in
          quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this
          might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes
          could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed
          in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double
          quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print()
          function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing
          quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:
        </p>
        <div>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                    '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                    >>> print('"Isn\'t," they said.')
                    "Isn't," they said.
                    >>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
                    >>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
                    'First line.\nSecond line.'
                    >>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
                    First line.
                    Second line.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you donâ€™t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as
          special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before the
          first quote:
        </p>
        <div>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
                        C:\some
                        ame
                    >>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
                        C:\some\name
                </code>
            </pre>

        <p>
          Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together
          other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as
          a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
          Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items
          all have the same type.
        </p>
        <div>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                    >>> squares
                        [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be
          indexed and sliced:
        </p>
        <div>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
                        1
                    >>> squares[-1]
                        25
                    >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
                        [9, 16, 25]
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          All slice operations return a new list containing the requested
          elements. This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy
          of the list:
        </p>
        <div>
          <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> squares[:]
                        [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                </code>
            </pre>
